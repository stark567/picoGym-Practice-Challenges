is this is the first time you are sshing to the particular network you will have to type "yes" aftering being prompted whether to add the network host to the list of your computer's known hosts. We are then prompted for the password to our ctf-player user which we get from the description and are able to get our bash shell. Looking at the files in our current directory we see a "1of3.flag.txt" file which we cat out as well as a "instructions-to-2of3.txt" file which we cat out to get a hint for where to find the next part of the flag.

```
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 1of3.flag.txt
picoCTF{xxsh_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-2of3.txt
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
ctf-player@pico-chall$
```

We get the first part of the flag and proceed to go to the root directory as the instructions told us to in order to find the next part of the flag. In the root directory we see a "2of3.flag.txt" file which we cat out to get the second part of the flag and a "instructions-to-3of3.txt" file which we cat out to get a hint for where to find the third and final part of the flag.


```

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd /
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-3of3.txt
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
ctf-player@pico-chall$
```

We use the instructions given and change to the home directory which is also often represented by the tilde symbol "~". Here we see the third and final part of the flag which we cat out and add to our previous parts to get the complete flag.
```
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
c1754242}
ctf-player@pico-chall$
```

# Flag:

```
picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_c1754242}
